### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Travis. I use he/him pronouns, and I work on a variety of projects in Python, Rust, Dart, and Java. 

While I'm not learning these at the moment, I am interested in learning C++ and Kotlin. C++ is heavily used throughout the 
amateur radio space, so picking it up will be a great addition to my skillset. 

While donations are not obligatory or required, they are greatly appreciated. I maintain several server platforms to host
my various projects, and those costs add up.

Check out my repositories to learn more about what I do!
